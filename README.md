# MATLAB-2025 Linear Systems and Rank Theorem

- Completed a MATLAB project for my Linear Algebra course at the University of Florida. The assignment explored different methods for solving linear systems and used MATLAB tools to investigate the Rank Theorem with various matrices.

## Project Overview

The project included three main exercises:

### 1. Solving Ax = b with A as a 3×3 Matrix
- Used three solution methods: RREF, MATLAB’s built-in operator (`A\b`), and Cramer’s Rule
- Compared performance and accuracy across methods
- Handled both regular and singular systems
- Used symbolic and numerical determinant tools

### 2. Solving Ax = b with General m×n Matrices
- Adapted Cramer’s Rule for square matrices with NaN detection for unsupported cases
- Tested randomized matrices of different sizes
- Explored behavior and consistency of solutions

### 3. Verifying the Rank Theorem
- Computed bases for null space, column space, and row space
- Used `rank()` and `rref()` to confirm theoretical results
- Interpreted geometric relationships between matrix spaces

## Tech Stack
- MATLAB R2023a
- `.m` and `.mlx` scripts
- Symbolic Math Toolbox

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on practice with symbolic and numerical linear algebra
- Improved understanding of matrix rank and solution spaces
- Learned how to validate theoretical concepts through computation
